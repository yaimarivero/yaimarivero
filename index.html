		<p>I am a photography who loves to take pictures of everything and anything to capture moments of everyday life. 

I was born and raised in San Francisco. I had many influences just from the city itself but mostly from my grandma. She used to take film photography when growing up and then transitioned into digital photography later on. Photographs she had taken of all the grandchildren and family members inspired me to start photography. I took film photography for about 2 years and then I took a black and white digital photography in college. 

When I take photos of objects and people that are important to me, I am able to take that important moment and share it with the world. It is one thing that I can always count on to show others what is going through my mind and seeing what I am seeing. Everyone has a different perspective of the world and that is what makes photography so special for me.

My digital media experience has expanded and grown throughout my time learning about it by using Photoshop and Illustrator. Those applications very much helped me improve my personal photos with Lightroom and perfecting them even more. It also has taught me coding my own website that I couldnâ€™t think was possible. But I did it!

What you will see on this page is my photography over the years starting back in 2016 and working my way up to 2018. A video I created and produced for a makeup tutorial. I hope you enjoy!!
